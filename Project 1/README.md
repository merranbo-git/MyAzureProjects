# MyAzureProjects - Project 1
# CI/CD Pipeline for .NET Web Application using Azure DevOps

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement a full CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps for a .NET web application. It includes automated build, testing, deployment to multiple environments (Dev, Staging, Prod), manual approval gates, and monitoring using Azure Monitor and Application Insights.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- ‚úÖ Store and manage source code using Azure Repos (Git)
- ‚úÖ Set up CI pipeline to restore dependencies, build, and run unit tests
- ‚úÖ Configure CD pipeline for automated deployment to Dev, Staging, and Production
- ‚úÖ Implement approval gates before production deployments
- ‚úÖ Enable monitoring using Azure Monitor and Application Insights

## üîß Prerequisites

- A .NET application hosted on GitHub: [`newlocalrepo`](https://github.com/merranbo1989/newlocalrepo.git)
- Azure App Services with 3 slots: **Dev**, **Staging**, **Production**
- Azure DevOps Organization and Project setup

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Breakdown

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Source Code Management

- Created a DevOps project and imported the GitHub repo
- Branching strategy:
  - `master`: Production-ready code
  - `dev`: Development branch
  - `staging`: UAT/Test environment
  - `feature/*`: Feature updates, merged into `dev`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Integration (CI)

- Created a build pipeline using the Azure DevOps ASP.NET template
- YAML pipeline includes:
  - NuGet restore
  - Build with MSBuild
  - Unit test with `DotNetCoreCLI`
  - Publish build artifacts

üîß Sample YAML Snippet
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - master
      - dev
      - staging

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

variables:
  solution: '**/*.sln'
  buildPlatform: 'Any CPU'
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: NuGetToolInstaller@1
- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    command: 'restore'
    restoreSolution: '$(solution)'
- task: VSBuild@1
  inputs:
    solution: '$(solution)'
    msbuildArgs: '/p:DeployOnBuild=true ...'
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'test'
    projects: '**/*[Tt]est*/*.csproj'
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Deployment (CD)
Separate release pipelines for each environment:
  - Dev: Automatic deployment on build success
  - Staging: Triggered after successful Dev deployment
  - Production: Triggered post-manual approval

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Approval Gates
  - Configured pre-deployment approval for Production environment
  - Ensures controlled and verified releases

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Execution and Validation
Code push to dev triggers:
  - Build pipeline ‚Üí Unit Tests ‚Üí Artifact creation
  - Dev ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Manual Approval ‚Üí Production
Verified deployment via app service URLs

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring
Enabled Application Insights in the Production slot
Integrated with Azure Monitor for:
  - Performance metrics
  - Failure tracking
  - Real-time insights

# ‚úÖ Outcomes
  ### End-to-end automation of build ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy
  ### Improved code quality through testing and approval gates
  ### Real-time production monitoring using Azure-native tools
